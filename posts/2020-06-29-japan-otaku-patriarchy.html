        <article id="main-article"><p>The way in which Otaku are talked about in terms of gender and especially as feminine, weak, and unsexual shows how deeply Patriarchy still determines our thoughts, in Japan as well as abroad.</p>
<p>I argue that critics who dismiss Otaku and Lolicon as somehow inherently sexist are operating in a frame of judgement that can only be sustained in reference to patriarchal ideas of desire as productive and childbearing and desire as exclusively &#39;real&#39; and &#39;useful&#39;, that in their perhaps honest, perhaps facetious critique of Otaku they themselves are strengthening the sexism they profess to abhor.</p>
<p>Pretending that children and women and the nexus between them, the young girl, cannot be sexual splits them in two: The pure, innocent virgin and the sexual creature. Since to the society, only the virgin exists, the sexual creature is hidden from sight. Even if she is abused, she cannot communicate it, for to communicate it would be to assert her existence - which doesn&#39;t exist. In this way <em>honne</em> and <em>tatemae</em> are constructed that only allow one one to <em>Gaman</em> one&#39;s suffering. Far from being a specifically Japanese phenomenon however, this is being imposed from the west.</p>
