The way in which Otaku are talked about in terms of gender and especially as feminine, weak, and unsexual shows how deeply Patriarchy still determines our thoughts, in Japan as well as abroad.

I argue that critics who dismiss Otaku and Lolicon as somehow inherently sexist are operating in a frame of judgement that can only be sustained in reference to patriarchal ideas of desire as productive and childbearing and desire as exclusively 'real' and 'useful', that in their perhaps honest, perhaps facetious critique of Otaku they themselves are strengthening the sexism they profess to abhor.

Pretending that children and women and the nexus between them, the young girl, cannot be sexual splits them in two: The pure, innocent virgin and the sexual creature. Since to the society, only the virgin exists, the sexual creature is hidden from sight. Even if she is abused, she cannot communicate it, for to communicate it would be to assert her existence - which doesn't exist. In this way *honne* and *tatemae* are constructed that only allow one one to *Gaman* one's suffering. Far from being a specifically Japanese phenomenon however, this is being imposed from the west.

Love capitalism (恋愛資本主義) seems to be an actual thing!

In a sense, then, Otaku opened a genuinely subversive space, which mainstream society struggled to close.

By all rights, I'm probably an Otaku. Otaku, at least in the US and German Anime scenefn:{Whenever I speak of anime in a general context, I mean to include Anime as well as Manga, Visual Novels and Dating Simulators, as well as other media with a anime/manga-esque aesthetic.} I am a part of, is defined mostly by self-identification as well as by clout in having watched many anime, owning anime merchandise, learning Japanese, and attending 'festivals' of anime. I score three out of four. And yet, I would hesitate to do so. I would hesitate to do so because there is a discourse that systematically misunderstands and devalues Otaku by means of ideas of the good life that are deeply capitalist and sexist in nature.

## Brief an die Leser*in

Hey,

I've just written a paper that I thought you might enjoy! You'll find the link at the end of this message, but first, let me sell you on why I think you'd benefit from reading it - because these are the points that sold me on writing the paper in the first place.

There's a term in Japanese called *love capitalism*. It describes three things: Broadly, the framework in which people do specific acts to be competitive in pursuit of a romantic partner, or perhaps rather the framework in which doing these acts is *necessary* to have a romantic partner. More specifically, it describes the situation in Japan where much of the romantic 'value' of a person is measured for men in terms of their jobs and for women in terms of their age, and where unmarried men are seen as 'failed men' and unmarried women as 'loser dogs' (負け犬 - *make inu*). Thirdly, it's the system that turns relationships themselves into a marketplace by associating them with a type of lifestyle that encourages consumption. The term *love capitalism* isn't native to English, but I'm sure these ideas sound both familiar and probably somewhat frustrating to you, as they are to me.

So, then, imagine my anger after reading about how Otaku (People who spend much of their time and income on a hobby, often Anime or Manga) see themselves as rejecting these norms as far as possible, and seeing examples of how their way of interacting both with media and with people, rather than being problematic  seems in many ways better and less implicitly violent than our day-to-day interactions; imagine my anger at reading article over article about these so-called 'failed men', with titles of articles as nuanced as 'Japan's Kiddie Porn Empire: Bye-Bye?' and academics of fields that really should know better than to take tabloid articles at face value parroting those same sentiments.
Frankly speaking, I think this is bullshit - but taking about Otaku is unattractive because a discussion of Otaku must include a discussion of underage drawn characters in explicit situations, so it's, of course, unpopular. You might have even tensed up while reading the last few words.
And yet, I think what I've found about Otaku is worth sharing. So, if you're up for it, let's peel the onion of public opinion, stigma, and disgust and find what's at the heart.

## Abstract

Otaku are often seen as failed men or sexual deviants. Both in Japan and abroad, they are often the subject of suspicion, mockery, and scorn. In this paper, I elucidate how this image is constructed and how, in contrast, otaku construct their own self-image. From a foreign perspective, otaku often come to symbolize all of Japan. For a specific subset of people, this results in an image that is positive and interesting, but this is merely the mirror image of the more prevailing idea, that Japan is different, strange, and in need of regulation, especially in regards to sexual content and *Lolicon*. The positive image is found in Japanese foreign language students, the negative prevails in the media. In Japan itself, much of the discourse focuses on Otaku's inability to find partners and become productive members of society, as can be seen by the vitriol launched at them in columns and speeches. A 'redemption story' of an Otaku, watched by 25% of the Japanese TV audience, involves them giving up on their identity completely to become happily coupled with a 'normal' woman. In contrast, Otaku themselves often express their desire to be separate from the social world and its unfulfillable demands, especially also *love capitalism*. They see their desire and affection (*moe* in Japanese) for non-real characters and worlds not as desire for an inferior substitute, but as something genuine in its own right. This births new forms of interaction with humans and characters alike. This is, however, not the sentiment of all Otaku, and there is a strong self-loathing voice present in the community. How much of this self-loathing represents societal attitudes seeping in and how much is genuine dissatisfaction remains unclear.

## Introduction

What is an otaku? At first blush, someone who consumes a lot of Japanese animated and drawn media. Open and shut case. And yet, there is a large amount of discourse in western countries and Japan alike about what otaku are and how they are "the savior of the post-bubble economy" (more rarely) or "failed men who watch kiddie porn" (more often). While this might be dismissed as mere breathless tabloid reporting, whenever a group is so simply damned for what seems like obvious and perhaps somewhat ridiculous deviancy, we should pay attention. Based on the fieldwork and extensive set of publications by anthropologist Patrick Galbraith, I will argue that the otaku is, through many lenses, distorted in such a way that the shadow they cast bears little resemblance to the actual thing. By being the point at which many different identities are negotiated, such as nationalism and orientalism but mainly gender and the good life, especially capitalist notions of the good life, the otaku signifies many things to many people, but rarely themselves. I will examine this discourse first from the perspective of foreigners writing about Japan, otaku, and anime, and then from the perspective of the Japanese national discourse on otaku, and especially on the Japanese 'critics' of otaku. After unraveling this discourse, I will set forth a tentative theory of how otaku might be understood to be living a genuinely different and radical conception of gender, of the good life. This will be ameliorated by considering some objections that are genuinely problematic to the self-conception of otaku. However, I conclude that in important ways, Otaku *are* living a different conception of the good life. They might even be offering us hints on how one might live a life more free of the shackles that keep us married, hard-working, and depressed. Will we listen?

## Otaku, orientalism and the western viewer

- How does the west see the Otaku
  - Western Otaku self-identification
    - There are many western Anime/Manga fans that see themselves as Otaku
    - Not important rn, since the word is used differently
    - But they are important in that they do self-professedly share aspects of japanese otaku culture, and have deeply ambivalent feelings about being an Otaku c::HillsTranscultOtaku;; p5ff
    - So we will return to this at the end

### The sexual lens

It is surprising how often the discussion of Otaku, who one would assume should be primarily defined through their media consumption, instead centers on their sexual activity. Specifically, they seem to be defined by two moments, an absence of 'normal sexual behavior' and a presence of 'abnormal sexual behavior.' Specifically, what is missing from Otaku, who are in this narrative almost always male, is proper masculine sexual intercourse with a woman. Places where this assumption appears are legion: c::HillsTranscultOtaku;; cites a 1995 film quizzing an Otaku on his sex life, and, when the Otaku tries evade this binary question, pressing him on whether he has in fact had sex with a human.

However, Otaku cannot be merely defined by their lack of sexual desires - especially given that 'wanting to have sex with many women' is part and parcel of the dominant American sexual identity. fnv:{Citation needed.} Therefore, more than just stories about 'sad men', western media and culture often focuses on the ridiculous and deviant sexual behavior that exists to fill this lack. fnv:{c::GalCoolJapan;;, p. 109} In some cases, this merely emphasizes the sad loneliness of being 'too attached' to something that is 'not real'. In popular culture, *body pillows* with Anime characters drawn on them have come to hypersignify this sort of failing, as one can see in parodies such as the one in the sitcom *30 rock*, where James Franco holds a body pillow and calls it Kimiko, much to the audience's amusement. fn:{The Moe Manifesto p. 4} But one needn't stop there: Many of the characters on those bodypillows, and most characters in Manga and Anime generally, are underage. fn:{Highschool-age seems to be the most common age group.} If Otaku desire these characters, how much of a leap is it really to say that Otaku consume child pornography? And how much further is it to say that Japan as a whole has a child pornography problem? Such a thought process seems to be behind headlines such as 'Japan's Kiddie Porn Empire: Bye-Bye?'fn:{See that the daily beast article}

How much this view is a view on Otaku in Japan, Otaku in 'the West', Otaku wherever they may be found, or even a generalization of Otaku traits onto Japan seems to vary. Morley and Robins 1995, cited by c::HillsTranscultOtaku;; claims that Otaku provide a 'symbol' for Japaneseness, beings that "despise physical contact and love media, technical communication and the realm of reproduction and simulation in general." Likewise, it's unclear if James Franco's 30 Rock parody is meant to parody otaku or Japan - probably both.

## Taking stock: Differences in the Japanese and International Perspectives

If we are trying to see the stereotypical views of Otaku in order to see through them, it is important to consider in how far either the perspective of us as (probably) non-Japanese, and in the case of the author, German-American readers color us, that is not to imagine a <q> nightmare of sameness in which a global and homogenised culture seeps across East and West. </q> fn:{c::HillsTranscultOtaku;;, p. 4} On the other hand, we need to be careful to steer clear of ascribing any and all differences to some sort of essential Japanese culture or Japaneseness. fnv:{c::HillsTranscultOtaku;;, p. 2ff}
In the struggle for the identity of Otaku, the Japanese state itself has a special interest, since their 'cool Japan' policies are invested in using Anime and Manga to promote the relevance of Japan abroad - and thus responsible for the higher public profile of the less-cool aspects of Anime and Manga. This in turn has led Japan to be more interested in policing these areas. fnv:{c::GalCoolJapan}
