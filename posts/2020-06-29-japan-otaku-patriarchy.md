The way in which Otaku are talked about in terms of gender and especially as feminine, weak, and unsexual shows how deeply Patriarchy still determines our thoughts, in Japan as well as abroad.

I argue that critics who dismiss Otaku and Lolicon as somehow inherently sexist are operating in a frame of judgement that can only be sustained in reference to patriarchal ideas of desire as productive and childbearing and desire as exclusively 'real' and 'useful', that in their perhaps honest, perhaps facetious critique of Otaku they themselves are strengthening the sexism they profess to abhor.

Pretending that children and women and the nexus between them, the young girl, cannot be sexual splits them in two: The pure, innocent virgin and the sexual creature. Since to the society, only the virgin exists, the sexual creature is hidden from sight. Even if she is abused, she cannot communicate it, for to communicate it would be to assert her existence - which doesn't exist. In this way *honne* and *tatemae* are constructed that only allow one one to *Gaman* one's suffering. Far from being a specifically Japanese phenomenon however, this is being imposed from the west.

Love capitalism (恋愛資本主義) seems to be an actual thing!

In a sense, then, Otaku opened a genuinely subversive space, which mainstream society struggled to close.

By all rights, I'm probably an Otaku. Otaku, at least in the US and German Anime scenefn:{Whenever I speak of anime in a general context, I mean to include Anime as well as Manga, Visual Novels and Dating Simulators, as well as other media with a anime/manga-esque aesthetic.} I am a part of, is defined mostly by self-identification as well as by clout in having watched many anime, owning anime merchandise, learning Japanese, and attending 'festivals' of anime. I score three out of four. And yet, I would hesitate to do so. I would hesitate to do so because there is a discourse that systematically misunderstands and devalues Otaku by means of ideas of the good life that are deeply capitalist and sexist in nature.

## Introduction

What is an otaku? At first blush, someone who consumes a lot of Japanese animated and drawn media. Open and shut case. And yet, there is a large amount of discourse in western countries and Japan alike about what otaku are and how they are "the savior of the post-bubble economy" (more rarely) or "failed men who watch kiddie porn" (more often). While this might be dismissed as mere breathless tabloid reporting, whenever a group is so simply damned for what seems like obvious and perhaps somewhat ridiculous deviancy, we should pay attention. Based on the fieldwork and extensive set of publications by anthropologist Patrick Galbraith, I will argue that the otaku is, through many lenses, distorted in such a way that the shadow they cast bears little resemblance to the actual thing. By being the point at which many different identities are negotiated, such as nationalism and orientalism but mainly gender and the good life, especially capitalist notions of the good life, the otaku signifies many things to many people, but rarely themselves. I will examine this discourse first from the perspective of foreigners writing about Japan, otaku, and anime, and then from the perspective of the Japanese national discourse on otaku, and especially on the Japanese 'critics' of otaku. After unraveling this discourse, I will set forth a tentative theory of how otaku might be understood to be living a genuinely different and radical conception of gender, of the good life. This will be ameliorated by considering some objections that are genuinely problematic to the self-conception of otaku. However, I conclude that in important ways, Otaku *are* living a different conception of the good life. They might even be offering us hints on how one might live a life more free of the shackles that keep us married, hard-working, and depressed. Will we listen?

## Otaku, orientalism and the western viewer

- How does the west see the Otaku
  - Western Otaku self-identification
    - There are many western Anime/Manga fans that see themselves as Otaku
    - Not important rn, since the word is used differently
    - But they are important in that they do self-professedly share aspects of japanese otaku culture, and have deeply ambivalent feelings about being an Otaku
    - So we will return to this at the end
  - Kiddie porn & Lolicon
    -
  - Attraction to body-pillows

## Otaku in their own words...
