<h1 id="early-new-high-german-and-the-idea-of-standard-german">Early New High German and the idea of Standard German</h1>
<p>Early New High German is a term used for German spoken between 1350[1]<br>or 1450[2] and 1650.[3] The periodization is relatively arbitrary.<br>During this time, the territory that will later be Germany was split<br>into many different political units, almost all of them under relatively<br>loose control by the Holy Roman Empire. Using 1450 as our starting date,<br>our period begins with there being (relatively) few manuscripts[4],<br>written in local ‘writing dialects’, but is bookended by a number of<br>grammars claiming to be grammars of “German” (“der Teutschen<br>Sprache”)[5], as well as societies for regulating “German”, most<br>notably the <em>fruchtbringende Gesellschaft</em>.[6] These are all referring<br>to “German”, not to “High German” or “Low German” or “German of the<br>Saxonian chancery”, so it seems that some idea – still far from fully<br>formed – of a standard language called “German” was emerging. And<br>indeed, this period sees Low German be relegated to a dialect,[7] and<br>increasing similarity in the orthography and vocabulary of written<br>works.[8] What it also sees, however, is the invention of movable type<br>printing and its spread all over Germany (and beyond),[9] and the<br>printing of hundreds of thousands of German bibles.[10] In how far did<br>printing contribute to the formation of this still nascent standard<br>language? This paper will aim to discuss the ways the printing press<br>might have been a factor in standardization, and how impactful it was.</p>
<h1 id="evidence-for-standardization">Evidence for standardization</h1>
<p>When talking about the standardization of German, what are we even<br>talking about? Mainly, the development of a linguistic norm, as an<br>additional layer to existing dialectal varieties, that do not get<br>replaced (at least not immediately),[11] but become marked as ‘wrong’<br>or ‘substandard’ for use in writing.[12] This involves two processes:<br>To apply a linguistic norm consistently within a document, and to have<br>this norm be binding for anyone writing German. The first process<br>appears trivial, but for the longest time, spelling and morphology could<br>vary wildly within one document. For one example, take Ulrich Schmidl, a<br>merchant turned conquistador who wrote down his experiences in South<br>America after his return home to Straubing 1554.[13] His original<br>manuscript, written in Middle Bavarian[14], is orthographically quite<br>inconsistent, often containing the same word in multiple different<br>spellings, e.g. modern <em>Baum</em> as <em>paumb, pauem, paim, paiemb, beim,<br>peÿm.</em> Certain inflections, such as plural, case, and mood are not<br>always clearly marked.[15] Even Martin Luther does not follow<br>consistent spelling rules, especially at first: He has 14 (!) different<br>variants of spelling <em>Wittenberg</em>, although he reduces this down to two,<br>probably due to the influence of his printers.[16] Consistent norms<br>were sometimes applied by printers and chanceries (of which more later),<br>but even those were based on regional printers- and scribal languages.<br>In these, and the local dialects they partially reflect, we do find most<br>of the features of modern Standard German, so that the process of<br>standardization must have been a process of selection of norms out of<br>the vast pool available. To prove this, let us compare some examples of<br>different written dialects, as well as modern Standard German. For the<br>beginning of our timeframe, there is no large basis of texts to compare,<br>and comparing all the various dialectal features and their<br>representation in graphs of early printed works would exceed the scope<br>of this analysis, so that the following is merely an illustrative<br>selection, taken from different prints of Luther’s ‘Septembertestament’:</p>
<p>1)  Melchior Lotther, Wittenberg, 1522:</p>
<p>“Vnd es war ynn yhrer schulen eyn mensch besessen mit eynem vnsaubern<br>geyst/ der schrey vnd sprach/ Hallt/ was haben wyr mit dyr zu schaffen/<br>Jhesu von Nazareth? Du bist komen vns zu verderben/ ich weys [...]<br>Jhesus bedrawete yhn [...] vnd fur aus von yhm [...] was ist das fur<br>ein newe lere [...]“</p>
<p>2)  Adam Petri, Basel, 1522:</p>
<p>„Vnd es war in iren schuͦlen ein mensch besessen mit einem vnsauberen<br>geyst/ der schrey vnd sprach/ Halt/ was haben wir mit dir zuͦ schaffen/<br>Jesu von Nazareth? du bist komen vns zuͦ verderben/ ich weysz [...]<br>Jesus betrauwete [...] vnd fuͦr ausz von im [...] was ist das für<br>ein neuwe lere [...]“</p>
<p>3)  Hanns Schönsperger, Augsburg, 1523:</p>
<p>„Vnd es war in<em>n</em> jrer schuͦlen ein mensch besessen mit einem vnsaubern<br>geyst/ der schrey vn<em>d</em> sprach/ Hallt/ was haben wir mit dir<br>zuͦschaffen/ Jesu von Nazareth? du bist komen vns zuͦuerderben/ ich<br>weisz [...] nd Jhesus bedrawete jn [...] vnd fuͦr ausz von jm<br>[...] was ist das für ein newe lere? [...]“</p>
<p>4)  Silvan Otmar, Augsburg, 1524:</p>
<p>„Vnd es was in irer schuͦlen ain mensch besessen mit ainem vnsauberen<br>gaist/ der schry vnd sprach/ Halt/ was haben wir mit dir zuͦschaffen<br>Jesu von Nazareth? du bist kōmen vns zuͦ verderben/ ich waisz [...]<br>vnd Jesus bedroͤwet jn [...] vnd fuͦr ausz von jm [...] was ist das<br>für ain new̌e leer? [...]“</p>
<p>5)  Melchior Ramminger, Augsburg, 1526:</p>
<p>„Und es was in iren schuͦlen ain mensch besessenn mitt ainem vnsauberen<br>gaist/ der schray und sprach: Halt/ wz haben wir mit dir zeschaffen Jesu<br>vonn Nazareth? du bist komēn vns zuͦ verderben: ich waisz [...] Und<br>Jesus beschalckt jn mit trōwen [...] vnd fuͦr ausz von jm. [...] Was<br>ist das für ain neuwe leer [...]“ [17]</p>
<p>6)  Modern Standard German spelling:</p>
<p>Und es war in ihrer Schule ein Mensch besessen von einem unsauberen<br>Geist/ der schrie und sprach: Halt/ was haben wir mit dir zu schaffen,<br>Jesu von Nazareth? Du bist gekommen, uns zu verderben/ ich weiß [...]<br>und Jesus bedrohte ihn [...] und fuhr aus von ihm. [...] Was ist das<br>für eine neue Lehre? [...]</p>
<p>We can see that (1) uses \&lt;y> when the others would have used either<br>\&lt;i> or \&lt;j>, and today would use \&lt;i>, \&lt;ie> and \&lt;ih>, amongst<br>others. \&lt;uͦ> is used for modern \&lt;u> and \&lt;uh>, but not in the first<br>text, which renders both modern \&lt;u> and \&lt;ü> as \&lt;u>. Some text uses<br>double consonants, especially for final sounds (especially (5)), modern<br>\&lt;ß> is rendered as \&lt;sz> most of the time (which is still the name<br>for \&lt;ß>), but just \&lt;s> by (1). There are variations in the use of<br>\&lt;t> and \&lt;d> (which are just graphs for the unvoiced and voiced<br>version of the same sound). The modern diphthong /ei/ is variably<br>rendered as \&lt;ei>, \&lt;ai>, \&lt;ey>.[18] What is visible is that none<br>of these texts is much more close to modern Standard German than any of<br>the others, and that most texts have some features that survive in<br>modern Standard German that the others do not have. We can also conclude<br>that these texts, for all their differences, are quite similar to modern<br>Standard German, so that standardization can be postulated as the main<br>way modern Standard German evolved from the language base of this time.</p>
<p>What of the changes by the end of the period? Comparing works from the<br>second half of the seventeenth century, we see a language that is far<br>more familiar to today’s German speakers:</p>
<p>“In Teutschland aber hatt man annoch dem latein und der kunst zuviel,<br>der Muttersprache aber und der Natur zu wenig zugeschrieben, welches<br>denn sowohl bey den gelehrten als bei der Nation selbst eine schädtliche<br>würckung gehabt“ (Leibnitz, 1682) [19]</p>
<p>Sixteenth-century authors also mention the existence of a standard<br>variety of German, so for example Schottel (“Die Hochteutsche Sprache<br>[…], ist nicht ein Dialectus eigentlich, sondern lingua ipsa<br>Germanica.“)[20] and Opitz, who mentions “eine Form des Dt., nach der<br>man sich richten [muss], wie nach dem Attischen bei den<br>Griechen.“[21]</p>
<p>So a norm for Standard German does seem to have begun evolving – but in<br>how far was the printing press involved?</p>
<h1 id="printing-in-german">Printing in German</h1>
<p>To determine whether printing was influential in the standardization of<br>German, we first need to examine what was being printed, where it was<br>being printed, and how much of it. After Gutenberg establishes his<br>movable type press, the technology starts spreading all over<br>Germany.[22] Importantly, most books being printed at this time were<br>still being printed in Latin. For the end of the fifteenth century,<br>Schirokauer (1951) notes the ratios of 27 : 2, 9 : 2, 3 : 1 of books<br>printed in Latin to those printed in German.[23] The numbers remain<br>similar for the begin of the sixteenth century, and by 1570, 70% of<br>prints are still in Latin.[24] It will take until 1681 for<br>German-language prints to overtake Latin ones. As for the amount, for<br>the early phases of printing (though it is not specified when exactly<br>that is) Schirokauer quotes an estimate of 200 copies per print<br>run[25], though this likely varies a lot, especially later in our time<br>period – with the number of works printed varying as well. These are the<br>amount of German-language prints during the begin and heyday of the<br>reformation:</p>

<h1 id="printing-as-a-factor-in-standardization-potential-factors">Printing as a factor in standardization – potential factors</h1>
<h2 id="standardization-for-the-export-market">Standardization for the export market</h2>
<p>Historically, the paradigmatic reason for printers to aim for a<br>standardized language that has been given was economic self-interest, to<br>be able to sell to a larger, export market.[27] And indeed, Polenz &amp;<br>Sperber (1978) uncritically assert that “die geschäftlichen Interessen<br>des Buchhandels wirkten darauf hin, daß man sich immer mehr bemühte,<br>grob Dialektisches aus der gedruckten Sprache fernzuhalten.” [28] But,<br>based on the figures of Latin to German prints and the small runs,<br>Schirokauer concludes that the printers’ economic base must have been<br>local. Schirokauer limits his investigation to the turn of the sixteenth<br>century though,[29] and conditions seem to have changed somewhat by</p>
<ol start="1565">
<li>In that year, a publishing house run in part by Sigmund Feyerabend<br>sold 2650 copies of 23 works to 50 different cities scattered throughout<br>Germany and even beyond.[30] Some printing houses, such as Froschauer<br>in Zürich, distinguished between books meant for a local market and ones<br>meant for export.[31] Hartweg (2005) offers up the perspective that<br>aside from big publishing houses, many small printers did exist (and<br>printed for the local market), but that many of these printers went out<br>of business as the flood of reformational and political pamphlets<br>subsided.[32] Even if a book was exported though, in how far would a<br>fifteenth-century reader even be hindered in their reading by dialectal<br>differences, presumably being exposed to many different dialects in the<br>very dialect-heterogenous world of fifteenth-century ‘Germany’?[33] If<br>printers edited their texts for economic reasons of some sort, there<br>must be more to it than intelligibility alone.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="internal-consistency-and-printer-s-languages">Internal consistency and printer’s languages</h2>
<p>And printers did significantly edit texts, not merely their orthography,<br>but also syntax, vocabulary, and in some places, much to the chagrin of<br>authors, even content.[34] Recall the aforementioned example of<br>Schmidl, the conquistador who had written down his experiences, and<br>who’s manuscript characterized by inconsistent spelling and sometimes<br>unclearly marked inflections. When it was printed in its first edition<br>by Sigmund Feyerabend[35] in 1567[36], spelling is much more<br>consistent, as is morphology, especially inflection.[37] In general,<br>compared to the manuscript, the edition is more concise and<br>precise.[38] Similarly, in the case of Hans Tucher, who had his<br>pilgrim report printed in 1482, the printed edition shows more<br>orthographic consistency, but also some coloring by the printer’s local<br>dialect.[39] Finally, Hans Sachs’ “Ständebuch”, printed 1568 - also by<br>Feyerabend -, shows higher consistency and different dialectal coloring<br>compared to the manuscript, although the dialectal coloring is reduced<br>in the edition.[40] So printers did often aim for consistency, at<br>least within one work. What seems to have motivated the printers is a<br>desire for quality.[41] This seems to have been a part of a shift in<br>mentality in general, as many authors started reworking their drafts,<br>sometimes multiple times, before printing them.[42] According to<br>Schulz (2014), while medieval copyists aimed for a complete text, print<br>was supposed to create a complete and final edition.[43] Since it<br>emerged before that works printed by the printer would often have the<br>printer’s dialectal coloring, and there are large printing houses such<br>as Feyerabend’s where this probably would be shared to some extent, and<br>taking the printers desire for internal consistency and thus quality,<br>it’s possible to see how this would have given rise to regional<br>printer’s languages, which is what we do see in the sixteenth<br>century.[44] These <em>could</em> be an intermediary step towards a standard<br>language, especially as printers tended to move multiple times during<br>their careers,[45] thereby exposing different printers languages to<br>each other. Huffines, quoting Moser (1969), claims “[...] Im Laufe des</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Jahrhunderts beginnt der Buchdruck, je mehr sich die örtlichen<br>Unterschiede abschleifen, desto stärker zur Einheit des Deutschen<br>beizutragen.“[46] Schirokauer argues strongly against this point,<br>marshalling a whole host of examples of print shops in which the<br>language varies wildly from edition to edition, switching between local<br>dialects and other, more widespread ones.[47] Schirokauer sees in this<br>chaos a “Mangel an Formsinn”[48], but that seems hard to substantiate,<br>given the above examples of printers and authors agonizing over form. It<br>seems equally as likely, though hard to prove, that the above examples<br>are instances of printing languages in contact, languages in the process<br>of becoming more similar. However, lacking very detailed quantitative<br>studies tracing spelling, morphology, and vocabulary through many<br>different printing houses, it is hard to determine if the printing<br>houses were indeed significantly contributing to the standardization of<br>the language as a whole, as opposed to just mirroring language changes<br>originating from elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="luther-as-a-standardizing-force">Luther as a standardizing force</h2>
<p>One person has often been supposed to have caused these changes: Martin<br>Luther. Martin Luther has often been regarded as having a large<br>influence on modern Standard German, sometimes even called the father of<br>modern Standard German.[49] And if Luther is the father, surely the<br>printing press must at least be the midwife? After all, Luther’s massive<br>reach – by 1626, more than 200 000 bibles had been printed in Wittenberg<br>alone - would have been impossible if his diverse works and invectives,<br>and especially, of course, the German bible, had not been so widely and<br>(relatively) cheaply available.[50]</p>
<p>By which mechanism might have Luther influenced German? On first blush,<br>the answer seems obvious: After all, at some points, Luther’s printed<br>works made up a third of all German works printed. But not just many,<br>but most prints were not actually sanctioned by Luther, but instead<br>unauthorized copies. By Luther’s death in 1546, 90 whole or partial<br>sanctioned bibles had been printed, compared with around 260<br>unauthorized ones. And every printer, sanctioned or not, made minor and<br>major edits. Luther himself did not follow particularly consistent<br>spelling, and his printers did not hesitate to edit it as they saw<br>fit.[51] His vocabulary does not suffer quite as strong editing,<br>however, and seems to have become commonly understood, as evidenced by<br>the Basel prints of Luther’s New Testament: 1523 they added glosses for<br>words they judged might be hard for readers to understand – but a few<br>years later they discontinued the practice, it having apparently become<br>unnecessary, as ‘Luther-Words’ had become widely understood.[52]<br>Nevertheless, reading this gloss today, most of the words are not in use<br>anymore, are archaic or even meaningless today. For each ‘aͤnlich’ there<br>is an ‘Affterreden’ and an ‘Altuättelisch’. Generally, analyses of the<br>similarity between ‘Luther-German’ and modern Standard German are a<br>mixed bag. The sounds indicated by the text are mostly the ones of<br>modern Standard German, but with some medieval holdovers.[53]<br>Similarly, his syntax is neither more ‘modern’ nor more ‘archaic’ than<br>the rest of the High German language area to this time.[54] He<br>undoubtedly secured some words’ place in the German language, which<br>otherwise would have remained regional,[55] but many of his choices<br>did not make it into modern Standard German.[56] In total, his choices<br>did not particularly influence modern Standard German.</p>
<p>And yet, in the grammars we will mention later, German will be elevated<br>by some to a place among the venerable languages of Hebrew and Greek, as<br>the language God chose to speak through “sein auserwähltes Instrument<br>Luther” (Clajus).[57] And indeed, the rising prestige of German must<br>be caused to a large part by the fact that now reading German would gain<br>you direct access to the scripture, which itself became a positive good<br>in protestant areas (sola scriptura). Ickelsamer, a student of Luther’s,<br>claims that there is “kaum ain werck oder creatur auf erden / die<br>zuͦgleich zu Gottes ehr vnd vnehr / mehr gebraucht würdt / denn die<br>lesekunst”[58] It is hard to imagine the sustained interest in the<br>German language that we see from the 1530s onwards without it being<br>invested with divine importance - and ecclesiastical scrutiny. This<br>investment of divine importance would not have been possible without the<br>printing press.</p>
<h2 id="exposure-effects">Exposure effects</h2>
<p>But Luther’s bible wasn’t the only thing people read. Many different<br>texts were published, by authors and printers all over the Holy Roman<br>Empire. Thus, the time after the invention of the printing press was the<br>first time that the many different varieties of German circulated<br>relatively widely. This would have shown many intellectuals how much<br>standardization really was necessary. And notice they do: Ickelsamer<br>complains that people writing German don’t think about how to arrange<br>their letters most subtly and correctly, Frangk bemoans that there is no<br>area in which the language doesn’t contain “etwas straffwirdigs/ oder<br>misbreuchiges”,[59] and Sattler notices that “daß dieser zeit vnder<br>zehen Personen nicht eine wie die andere die teutsche Spach<br>schreibt.”[60] Good, then, that the printing press also created a<br>base of texts on which to base orthographies and grammars for the German<br>language. Luther’s bible translation, of course, but also many others;<br>Frangk mentions Emperor Maximillian’s chancery and Johan Schönsperger,<br>an Augsburg printer, as well.[61] Motivated by the bad examples and<br>the good, language-reformers began printing both basic orthographies,<br>and later, German grammars.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-german">Teaching German</h2>
<p>In the sixteenth century, schools for German begin to become more and<br>more common. They had been spreading since the thirteenth century,[62]<br>but really got going during the Reformation. As German gained in<br>prestige, Luther and other reformers began calling for the creation of<br>schools.[63] Some towns also stressed worldly benefits, since nothing<br>important could now happen in the world without it being printed.[64]<br>Early books about how to spell and write start to be printed, such as<br>Ickelsamer’s <em>Die rechte weis auffs kürtzist lesen zu lernen</em> […]<br>(1527) and Kolroß’ <em>Enchiridion: das ist Handbuchlin tütscher<br>Orthographi</em> […] (1530),[65] and Luther’s bible becomes a<br>cornerstone of protestant schooling.[66] Cheaper ‘teutsche Schulen’<br>would often teach religious knowledge and ‘proper behavior’ as well as<br>German, and often relied on protestant materials, such as Luther’s<br>catechism.[67] The orthography of the manuals and religious works used<br>for education would have varied based on the printer’s location, of<br>course, perhaps even for the orthographical material – a handbook for<br>grammar and orthography by Meichßner suffered that fate[68] – but<br>would have further served to secure whatever tendencies had developed in<br>print languages in the writing (and reading!) practice of the society.</p>
<h2 id="writing-about-writing-german-language-grammars">Writing about writing: German-language grammars</h2>
<p>Next to these simpler didactic works, and learning by Luther-imitation,<br>slowly more ambitious grammars emerged - perhaps motivated by factors<br>mentioned earlier. Fabian Frangk and Johann Elias Meichßner publish<br>tracts on orthography in the 1530s.[69] In the second half of the<br>sixteenth century, three Latin grammars of German appeared, which aimed<br>to shape how foreigners learned the language.[70] Later, in the<br>seventeenth century, a few more influential grammars are published, and<br>the focus slowly starts moving away from defining German orthography and<br>grammar and towards protecting it from foreign influences.[71]</p>
<p>It is unclear, however, how much influence these grammars had. For<br>example, these grammars often even reflect an existing standard when<br>claiming to regulate something for the first time.[72] Often, the<br>suggestions made by these grammatical reformers reflect rules that do<br>not point in the direction of modern usage. Many of them point to<br>Luther’s bible translations as examples to imitate, but the editions<br>they were pointing to were reprints, inadvertently following the trends<br>of language change German was experiencing at that time, rather than<br>prescribing something different. Additionally, we don’t have detailed<br>figures for copies printed, so that it is hard to know how widely these<br>reformers were read.[73] If they were widely read, however, this would<br>have only been possible thanks to the printing press.</p>
<h2 id="preempting-printing-chanceries">Preempting printing: Chanceries</h2>
<p>When looking at the early reasons and mechanisms for the standardization<br>of German, chanceries are the big competitor to the printing press.<br>Chanceries were quite common in medieval and early modern Europe, first<br>as part of royal courts, but later also as part of city<br>administrations.[74] Many influential German authors of the sixteenth<br>and seventeenth century cite chanceries as influential for their<br>language, not least of which Luther, who claims that he follows the<br>“Sechsichen cantzley, quam imitantur omnes duces et reges Germaniae;<br>[...] Ideo est communissima lingua Germaniae.”[75] So, even before<br>Luther’s bible (however changed by printers) or large printing houses<br>themselves could become models for imitation, chanceries served as a<br>model for imitation.</p>
<p>The chanceries influence can also be seen in a different area. We find<br>evidence of these chanceries influencing each other, especially when a<br>change was adopted by the more prestigious ones. For example, Niklas von<br>Wyle complains that “so bald sy [other writers] etwas nüwes sechen usz<br>ein fürsten cantzlie, […] sich des gebruchent wie die affen.”[76]<br>The chancery often put pressure on its scribes to adopt these<br>changes.[77] This created intra-chancery ‘scribal languages’ which by<br>the aforementioned process became ‘scribal language areas.’ These areas,<br>and the printer languages mentioned before, basically overlap<br>one-to-one,[78] which raises the suspicion that printer languages were<br>merely continuing a process of leveling of dialectal differences which<br>had begun long before with the chanceries.</p>
<h1 id="how-impactful-was-the-printing-press-">How impactful was the printing press?</h1>
<p>To conclude: In how far did printing contribute to the formation of<br>Standard German? Printer’s editing and printer’s languages must have had<br>some impact, though if they originated the changes or merely amplified<br>trends already present in the chanceries is far from clear. Luther might<br>have contributed some words to the modern Standard German vocabulary –<br>but a lack of these would not have impeded standardization. Luther’s<br>raising of the prestige of the German language, though, seems more<br>pivotal, and the basis for much of the German-language schooling and the<br>motivation for grammatical reforms. This, together with the effects of<br>exposing the heterogenous state of German, especially its orthography,<br>is the avenue via which the printing press probably most affected and<br>accelerated the formation of Standard German. Without large-scale<br>quantitative analyses, however, any conclusion must be tentative, as for<br>any trend mentioned here, enough counterexamples can be found to muddy<br>the waters to the point of unclarity.</p>
<p>There is a way, though, in which this analysis cannot reveal the true<br>impact of the printing press, in which it misses the point entirely.<br>Most of the linguistic standardization and reform occurred later, from<br>1650 onward via the establishment of a German state, universal schooling<br>system and near-universal literacy. All these phenomena are bound up in<br>a world in which the printing press is inextricably enmeshed. The world<br>of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, of imperial Germany is<br>unimaginable without newspapers, a complex bureaucratic and legal system<br>reliant on print, and teachers and schoolmasters teaching rules from<br>compact grammars of the German language. Similarly, 17th- and<br>18th-century German intellectuals might have debated the corruption or<br>enrichment of the German language via loanwords[79], but these would<br>have never had the cultural cachet or the exposure to influence the<br>German language if they hadn&#39;t been featured in widely-printed<br>foreign-language military manuals or scientific treatises. The world of<br>the early modern period and beyond itself, the world that produced the<br>very standardized German language used today, is - inevitably or<br>contingently - in part a product of the printing press.</p>
